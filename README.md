# Controller

This app uses hand tracking and phone controller for controller input.
This app converts hand tracking and phone controller input to Oculus Touch controller input.

## Hand Tracking

Nreal Light's hand tracking is often falsely detected when five fingers cannot be identified.
Therefore, the input is valid only when the hand is facing in a direction that makes it easy to identify the five fingers.
Input is valid only when the hand is facing the angle between MinAnglePalmFacingFront and MaxAnglePalmFacingFront.

The app converts hand movements into controller input as follows:

| Hand                                                                                                             | Controller                                      |

| the angle exceeded ThresholdAngleForTrigger                                                                      | trigger touch                                   |
| The angle has reached MaxAngleForTrigger                                                                         | trigger click                                   |

When the Button Panel on the phone controller is on, the buttons appear in space when you turn the back of your hand to the front.

## Phone Controller

The app converts the phone controller input to the controller input as follows:

| Phone Controller                   | Controller                    |
|------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Menu button touch                  | menu click                    |
| System button touch                | system (Oculus button) click  |
| left / right Thumb buttons touch   | left / right thumbstick click |
| left / right Trigger buttons touch | left / right trigger click    |
| left / right Grip buttons touch    | left / right grip click       |
| A button touch                     | A click                       |
| B button touch                     | B click                       |
| X button touch                     | X click                       |
| Y button touch                     | Y click                       |

# Settings

## Hand Rotation

You can adjust the orientation of the controller.
The default is set to (90,90,0) according to the orientation of the hand.
If it is difficult to point with the laser, set it to (0,0,0). 
The center of the slider is 0.

By turning on Cache Values, the current settings are saved in the cache and the default value is set to the current value.
By turning off Cache Values, the cached values will be the current values.

## Gear Icon Button

You can open the setting dialog from the gear icon.
If you rewrite the value of the text field and press the submit button, the setting will be changed.
If there is a problem with the input content, the content of the problem will be displayed in the Message line of the text field.

If you delete all the text fields and then press the submit button, it will be the default setting.

The following are the items that can be set.

| Item Name                        | Data Type | Default Value          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                      |

# Troubleshooting

## The image does not move following the movement of the head

Close all running apps and restart Nreal Launcher.
